Nearly twenty years after the Black Mesa Incident the G-Man wakes Gordon Freeman and inserts him 
(seemingly, without any goals) into a train arriving in City 17, 
a city under control of the Combine Empire located somewhere in Eastern Europe.


Nearly twenty years after the Black Mesa Incident the G-Man wakes Gordon Freeman and inserts him (seemingly, without any goals) into 
a train arriving in City 17, a city under control of the Combine Empire located somewhere in Eastern Europe.
After leaving the train, Gordon and other passengers are welcomed by a broadcast by Dr. Wallace Breen, former administrator of
Black Mesa, who is now Earth's administrator. Continuing on his way, Gordon meets armed Civil Protection officers policing the train station and its surroundings. 
One of them separates him from the rest of the arriving citizens and directs him into a small interrogation room before revealing himself to be former 
Black Mesa security guard Barney Calhoun, operating undercover for the Resistance.
